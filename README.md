# TriviaGame

This Star Wars themed game of trivia  was made using a combination of Jquery and Javascript.

The game has 10 questions with a 20 sec timer for each question. To start the game the player presses the start button revealing the question with 4 possible choices. The player then must make a selection and press the ready button to make the choice final and reveal if it was the correct choice. If the answer is wrong the correct choice will become green and the choice they made will be red, if no choice is made then only the correct answer will be shown. The game will keep track of questions guessed right and will reveal this at the end of the game where the player may also press the a button to reset the game.
